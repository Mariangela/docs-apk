# apk-docs

This repository contains the documentation website for APK, which is an API Platform for Kubernetes.

We use the [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) framework to convert documentation written in markdown (.md) format to a static single page website.

## Setting up locally

[Build and run the APK documentation](https://github.com/wso2-enterprise/apk-docs/wiki/Build-and-run-the-docs-locally) locally.


## Developer Guide

Refer [Developer Wiki](https://github.com/wso2-enterprise/apk-docs/wiki) for more information related to development of APK documentation.
